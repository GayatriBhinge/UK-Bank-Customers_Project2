The management team is interested in gaining insights into their customer demographics, financial behaviors, and trends. Specifically, they are looking to understand the distribution of customers by region and gender, evaluate financial metrics based on job classifications and age ranges, and identify trends in customer acquisition throughout the year 2015.
